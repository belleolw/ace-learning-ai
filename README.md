# Ace Learning AI Dashboard

Ace Learning AI is a prototype **AI-powered adaptive learning dashboard** designed for tuition centres. The system demonstrates how **learning analytics and machine learning** can help students, parents, and teachers monitor academic performance, detect weak topics early, and plan targeted interventions.

This project was built as part of the **IS215 Digital Business & Technology Transformation** module.

---

# System Overview

The system consists of three main components:

```text
React Dashboard (Frontend)
        ↓
Flask API (Backend)
        ↓
Learning Analytics Model (Machine Learning)
        ↓
Student Learning Dataset
```

The frontend dashboards consume analytics insights from the backend API, which runs the machine learning model to generate predictions and insights.

# Setup Instructions

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/belleolw/ace-tuition-AI.git
cd ace-tuition-AI
```

---

# Running the Full System

This project consists of a **React frontend** and a **Flask backend**.
You must run both services concurrently.

⚠️ Note: On Mac, you must use python3 instead of python and use a virtual environment due to system restrictions.

---

## 2. Backend Setup (Flask API)

Navigate to backend:

```bash
cd ace-learning-backend
```

### Install dependencies

#### Mac / Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\\Scripts\\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run backend API

```bash
cd learning-analytics/learning_analytics_model
```

#### Mac / Linux
```bash
python3 app.py
```

#### Windows
```bash
python app.py
```

Backend will run at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5001
```

---

## 3. Frontend Setup (React Dashboard)

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
cd ace-learning-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run at:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## 4. Login Instructions

Once the frontend is running:

- Open: http://localhost:5173
- Enter any test Student ID (e.g. S044, S005, S091)

---

## 5. Optional: API Entry Point

If using the alternative API structure:

```bash
cd ace-learning-backend/api
python3 index.py   # Mac/Linux
# python index.py  # Windows
```

---

## Notes

- Ensure backend is running before frontend
- If API errors occur, verify API base URL in:

```text
ace-learning-frontend/src/config/api.js
```

- Default backend URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5001
```

---
